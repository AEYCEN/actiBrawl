### ‚ùî Description

This tool is a Brawl Stars MegaPig activity calculator. It determines the recommended minimum requirement of wins and tickets to be
used for the next MegaPig event based on the results of the last event. The calculation assumes that each player has used 
all tickets, as this would have been theoretically possible.
